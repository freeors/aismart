#. TRANSLATORS: This is the language code which will be used
#. to store and fetch localized non-textual resources, such as images,
#. when they exist. Normally it is just the code of the PO file itself,
#. e.g. "de" of de.po for German. But it can also be a comma-separated
#. list of language codes by priority, when the localized resource
#. found for first of those languages will be used. This is useful when
